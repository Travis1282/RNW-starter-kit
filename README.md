### react-native-web Starter Kit 

This is a simple, functional, base to begin your ios, android and webapp supported with single code base. 

This is a react app turned react native application which, with the help of [react-native-web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web), runs React Native components and APIs on the web using React DOM on the web eliminating the need for a separate instance 

In order to view on ios or android you must have an [Expo](https://expo.io/) account and app. 

To use the starter kit run:

```
yarn
```
then

```
yarn start-expo
```
and in a new terminal window
```
yarn start-web

```
